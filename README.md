# sn@il - .eml file reader

project was made to automize my job as a pr assistant. My boss forwards me bounced emails as attachments on Outlook in .eml format, and I am to go through each of them to update our salesforce contacts. 

So I built sn@il to automize this a bit. Sometimes I recieve up to 25 separate .eml file attachments and this helps me read the files without having to open them one by one.
